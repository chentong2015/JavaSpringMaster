TODO. 不同的JDBC处理Lob大对象的方式不同，需要额外配置
Cause JDBC deals with LOB data varies from driver to driver.
Hibernate tries to take care of all these differences, Hibernate is only partially successful at achieving this goal.
For some database drivers (i.e. PostgresSQL), it's necessary to do some extra work to get LOBs functioning.

TODO. 大对象的存储必须要放到transaction事务中，因为它可能是一个耗时的操作
A large object can be stored in several records
that's why you have to use a transaction. All records are correct or nothing at all.
